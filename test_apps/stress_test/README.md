# Datadog SDK Stress Test

This app is meant to be used to stress test the Datadog Flutter SDK.

It divides tests into three areas:
* Large payloads - adding large amounts of data to any Log `attributes` or `context` variables
* High frequency - sending a lot of logs or RUM events
* Mapping - adding mapping functions

In the interest of being a stress test, both `uploadFrequency` and `batchSize` are set to the highest options.

You can enable / disable the mapping functions in `main.dart`.

## A Note About Mapping Functions

Mapping functions are meant to be used to quickly discard unwanted events or modify events to remove any data you do not want sent to Datadog. If these functions take too long (say if you are debugging them, or if they are too complex) they will send the **unmodified** version to Datadog. 

These stress tests were used to determine the reasonable values for that wait. We checked the timing for large payloads in debug versions of both iOS and Android on devices and simulators to determine that delay.
