* Send `firstPartyHosts` to Native SDKs during initialization. Make
  `firstPartyHosts` property on read only `DatadogSdk` read only. 
* 💥 Breaking! - Deprecated Tracing. Tracing APIs are still available but will be removed before 1.0.

## 1.0.0-alpha.2

  from leaking native resources)
* Remove native view tracking (Activities and Fragments) from Android by default

  `LoggingConfiguration.loggerName`
* Add support for configuring whether loggers send data to Datadog:

  replaced with a standalone `datadog_tracking_http_client` package.

  longer defaults to `DatadogSite.us1`
