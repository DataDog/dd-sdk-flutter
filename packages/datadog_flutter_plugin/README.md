## Overview

Datadog Real User Monitoring (RUM) enables you to visualize and analyze the real-time performance and user journeys of your Flutter applicationâ€™s individual users.

RUM supports monitoring for Flutter Android and iOS mobile applications.

### iOS

Your iOS Podfile must have `use_frameworks!` (which is true by default in Flutter) and target iOS version >= 11.0.

### Android

On Android, your `minSdkVersion` must be >= 19, and if you are using Kotlin, it should be version >= 1.5.31.

## Setup

### Specify application details in the UI

1. In the [Datadog app][1], navigate to **UX Monitoring** > **RUM Applications** > **New Application**.
2. Choose `Flutter` as the application type.
3. Provide an application name to generate a unique Datadog application ID and client token.

To ensure the safety of your data, you must use a client token. For more information about setting up a client token, see the [Client Token documentation][4].

### Create configuration object

Create a configuration object for each Datadog feature (such as Logging, Tracing, and RUM) with the following snippet. By not passing a configuration for a given feature, it is disabled.

```dart
// Determine the user's consent to be tracked
final trackingConsent = ...
final configuration = DdSdkConfiguration(
  clientToken: '<CLIENT_TOKEN>',
  env: '<ENV_NAME>',
  site: DatadogSite.us1,
  trackingConsent: trackingConsent,
  nativeCrashReportEnabled: true,
  loggingConfiguration: LoggingConfiguration(
    sendNetworkInfo: true,
    printLogsToConsole: true,
  ),
  tracingConfiguration: TracingConfiguration(
    sendNetworkInfo: true,
  ),
  rumConfiguration: RumConfiguration(
    applicationId: '<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>',
  )
);
```

### Initialize the library

You can initialize RUM using one of two methods in the `main.dart` file.

1. Use `DatadogSdk.runApp`, which automatically sets up error reporting and resource tracing. 

   ```dart
   await DatadogSdk.runApp(configuration, () async {
     runApp(const MyApp());
   })
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can manually set up error tracking and resource tracking. Because `DatadogSdk.runApp` calls `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized`, if you are not using `DatadogSdk.runApp`, you need to call this method prior to calling `DatadogSdk.instance.initialize`.

   ```dart
   runZonedGuarded(() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     final originalOnError = FlutterError.onError;
     FlutterError.onError = (details) {
       FlutterError.presentError(details);
       DatadogSdk.instance.rum?.handleFlutterError(details);
       originalOnError?.call(details);
     };

     await DatadogSdk.instance.initialize(configuration);

     runApp(const MyApp());
   }, (e, s) {
     DatadogSdk.instance.rum?.addErrorInfo(
       e.toString(),
       RumErrorSource.source,
       stackTrace: s,
     );
   });
   ```

### Track RUM views

The Datadog Flutter Plugin can automatically track named routes using the `DatadogNavigationObserver` on your MaterialApp.

```dart
MaterialApp(
  home: HomeScreen(),
  navigatorObservers: [
    DatadogNavigationObserver(),
  ],
);
```

This works if you are using named routes or if you have supplied a name to the `settings` parameter of your `PageRoute`.

Alternately, you can use the `DatadogRouteAwareMixin` property in conjunction with the `DatadogNavigationObserverProvider` property to start and stop your RUM views automatically. With `DatadogRouteAwareMixin`, move any logic from `initState` to `didPush`. 

### Automatic Resource Tracking

You can enable automatic tracking of resources and http calls from your RUM views using the [datadog_tracking_http_client](https://pub.dev/datadog_tracking_http_client) package. Just add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`, and add the following to your initialization:

```dart
final configuration = DdSdkConfiguration(
  // configuration
)..enableHttpTracking()
```

If you want to enable Datadog distributed tracing, you must also set the `DdSdkConfiguration.firstPartyHosts` configuration option.

## Data Storage

### Android

Before data is uploaded to Datadog, it is stored in cleartext in your application's cache directory.
This cache folder is protected by [Android's Application Sandbox][1], meaning that on most devices
this data can't be read by other applications. However, if the mobile device is rooted, or someone
tampers with the linux kernel, the stored data might become readable.

### iOS

Before data is uploaded to Datadog, it is stored in cleartext in the cache directory (`Library/Caches`)
of your [application sandbox][2], which can't be read by any other app installed on the device.
