# Datadog Tracking HTTP Client Plugin

> A plugin for use with the Datadog SDK, used to track performance of HTTP calls and enable Datadog Distributed Tracing.

## Getting started

To use this plugin, enable it during configuration of your SDK. In order to enable Datadog Distributed Tracing, you also need to set the `firstPartyHosts` property in your configuration object.

```dart
import 'package:datadog_tracking_http_client/datadog_tracking_http_client.dart';

final configuration = DdSdkConfiguration(
  // configuration
  firstPartyHosts: ['example.com'],
)..enableHttpTracking()
```

## Using http.Client wrapping

This package also supplies a composable client usable with the [http pub package](https://pub.dev/packages/http) called `DatadogClient`. For most scenarios, Datadog recommends you use the HTTP tracking method above, but there are a few scenarios where using `DatadogClient` might make more sense:

* If you are using native HTTP libraries like [cronet_http](https://pub.dev/packages/cronet_http) or [cupertino_http](https://pub.dev/packages/cupertino_http), which do not work with the above tracking method.
* If you only want to track specific resource requests.

If you are using `cronet_http` or `cupertino_http`, you can combine `DatadogClient` with the above tracking method. Otherwise, the two methods may interfere with each other.

To use the `DatadogClient`, create and compose the `Client` from the `http` package:

```dart
import 'package:datadog_tracking_http_client/datadog_tracking_http_client.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

final configuration = DdSdkConfiguration(
  // specifying firstPartyHosts is still necessary to
  // enable distributed tracing
  firstPartyHosts: ['example.com'],
)

final httpClient = http.Client()
final datadogClient = DatadogClient(datadogSdk: DatadogSdk.instance, innerClient: httpClient);
```

The `innerClient` parameter is optional. If it is not supplied, DatadogClient will create a `Client` for you with default options.

## Flutter 2.8 Support

Flutter 3.0 updated to Dart 2.17, which added two methods to HttpClient. 

Currently, `version 1.1.x` sets a version constraint to Dart >= 2.17. If you need to support versions of Flutter prior to 3.0, back to flutter 2.8, use `version 1.0.x` instead. There is no difference between these versions other than support for lower versions of Dart.
