# Datadog Flutter Plugin -  Simple Example

This is a more realistic example of how you use the Datadog Flutter Plugin in a real-world scenario.  This includes:
    
    * Using GoRouter with the DatadogNavigationObserver
    * Automatic network tracing with `datadog_tracking_http_client`
    * User interaction tracking with RumUserActionDetector
    * Error/Crash handling with manually reported errors
