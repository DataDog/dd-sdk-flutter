# Customizing Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also customize the launch screen directly in your Flutter project's Xcode project with the following steps:

1. Open your Xcode project:`open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`. 
2. Select `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator.
3. Place your images into the `Runner/Assets.xcassets` location.
