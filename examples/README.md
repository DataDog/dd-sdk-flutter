# Datadog Flutter Plugin - Additional Examples

This folder contains examples of using the Datadog Flutter Plugin in more complicated scenarios than what is covered in the [bundled example](../../packages/datadog_flutter_plugin/example/). It also serves as a test bed for those more complicated setups.

This includes:

* [Simple Example](./simple_example) - Includes examples of GoRouter integration, distributed tracing, interaction tracking, and error/crash reporting.
* [Add-to-App / Hybrid Native + Flutter](./native-hybrid-app)


If you have other scenarios that are not covered in this list, please reach out to Datadog.
